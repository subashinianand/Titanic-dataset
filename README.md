Introduction

The Titanic dataset contains passenger details from the 1912 ship disaster. It is commonly used to learn data analysis and machine learning concepts. 
This project uses Python and Pandas to study survival patterns.

Dataset Overview

The dataset includes information such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and survival status. 
It contains both numerical and categorical data. Some missing values are handled during preprocessing.

Methodology

The Titanic dataset was imported from Kaggle and analyzed using Pandas in Python. Data cleaning methods such as handling missing values and filtering were applied. Grouping and statistical calculations were performed to identify survival patterns.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical methods like mean, grouping, and survival rate calculation are applied. Analysis is done based on gender, class, and fare. 
These methods help identify key survival factors.

Conclusion

The study shows that gender and passenger class strongly influenced survival. Female and first-class passengers had higher survival rates.
The project demonstrates effective data analysis using Pandas.
